<h2>Software "hate list"</h2>
<h3>Proprietary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Most of. Reinventing the wheel is not a good idea even in software development. Hard to tinker with when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Free</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CVS. Accumulated lots of "fixes" which break any assumptions about interface. Can be reliable manipulated only by cvs(1). Brain-damaged design of hooks. Lack of changesets. CVSNT.</li>
  <li>Eclipse. Resource hog.</li>
  <li>Emacs. Lacks controlled cross-module code/data protection. Elisp is ugly: Lisp-2 and existing code does not use newly-introduced lexical scopes.</li>
  <li>Firefox. Keyboard focus is buggy and unfixable. Lack of consistent user interface.</li>
  <li>Git. Horrible user interface.</li>
  <li>Moodle. Horrible internals.</li>
  <li>OTRS. Horrible internals.</li>
  <li>Perl. Too much marketing for horrible language.</li>
  <li>Python. Lacks marketing.</li>
  <li>Rails. Too much hype.</li>
</ul>
