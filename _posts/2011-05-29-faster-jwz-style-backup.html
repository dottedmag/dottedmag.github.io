title: Faster JWZ-style backup
---
<p>
  I am a huge fan of <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html">Jamie
  Zawinski's style of doing backups</a> (which basically means you make a full
  copy of you disk every night and in case disk dies you replace it with
  identical in no time).
</p>
<p>
  There is one small implementation problem with this approach though: our disks
  grew tremendously in last years, and did not speed up too much to compensate
  size growth, which means making a full copy of even a laptop drive could take
  a lot of time (and no, using rsync as JWZ recommends is not an option, as you
  still have to deal with partition table, boot sector, LVM and $DEITY knows
  what else).
</p>
<p>
  It wouldn't be <i>that</i> bad if full SATA speed could be achieved, but eSATA
  enclosures are still a bit expensive, so I hook up my backup drive using USB,
  which is much slower.
</p>
<p>
  In order to make the backup a bit faster I scratched
  a <a href="https://github.com/dottedmag/bdrsync">small utility</a>
  called <tt>brdrsync</tt> which reads the both disks' contents, compares it and
  only writes back to backup drive those sectors which are changed since last
  backup. Really helps. Not sure why.
