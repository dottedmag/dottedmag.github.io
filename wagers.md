# Wagers

A wager is a useful tool for intellectual honesty: debating is cheap if nothing
is at stake, and self-imposing financial incentives makes for a better quality
of thinking.

## ASI in Go

Go [automatically inserts semicolons](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/XuMrWI0Q8uk).

I believe is that Go grammar and mandatory use of `gofmt` make ASI safe to use in Go, unlike [some other languages](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat).

To disprove that a real bug in real Go codebase caused by ASI has to be
demonstrated.

The codebase in question should not be created solely for the purpose of winning
this wager, IOW the bug should be real and not a contrived example. The best way
to demonstrate that is to point to a commit that fixes a bug introduced due to
Go ASI.
