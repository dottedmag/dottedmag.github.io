Dear @BEARER@,

I entrust you with a share of a password for my primary PGP/ssh keys.

This will be required in case of catastrophical loss of my possessions or to
allow my spouse to regain access to my computers and online accounts in case of
my death.

** WHAT TO DO WITH THIS MESSAGE? **

Please keep this message indefinitely or until I ask you to destroy it.

* If I contact you and ask to hand it over, please verify my identity and then
  hand it over.

* If my spouse contacts you and asks to hand it over, please verify her
  identity, verify that I am dead and then hand it over. Please help her to
  recover the keys in case she asks for it.

* If someone else requests it and you are not aware of my death or you detect
  someone impersonating as me or my wife, please notify me and my spouse
  immediately.

Sincerely yours, Mikhail Gusarov.
