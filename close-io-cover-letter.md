title: Mikhail Gusarov - Cover Letter for Close.io
---

This is the first time I need to provide an URL for a cover letter. Clever!

I am looking for a place where I can get more responsibility and work on bigger
projects than I currently do.

I am an experienced software engineer with a varied experience (from embedded
Linux distribution to B2B SaaS service, from Eclipse-based IDE to Unix server
automation).

Your technology stack is familiar to me: I am working with ElasticSearch, AWS
and MongoDB at my current place of work, used PostgreSQL and Redis previously
and played with Doker and Kubernetes.

I have worked on B2B and B2C SaaS applications, focusing on optimization and
scaling.

I do care about the code quality. At one of my places of work I have introduced
unit and acceptance testing, continuous integration, and repeatable release
process, and decreased the number of mutable global variables in the codebase by
an order of magnitude. It was a server automation software. Yes, a server
automation software which was previously released without even running a
regression testing suite.

I am very comfortable working remotely (8 years, 4 of them managing a small
distributed team). In fact, I'm only looking for a position in a fully
distributed team.
