For a number of reasons, i've recently set up a new OpenPGP key, and will be
transitioning away from my old one.

The old key will continue to be valid for some time, but i prefer all future
correspondence to come to the new one.  I would also like this new key to be
re-integrated into the web of trust.  This message is signed by both keys to
certify the transition.

the old key was:

pub   1024D/A26F54C8 2004-06-14
      Key fingerprint = 4D8A DAC8 CD9E 50D0 024D  7436 BEC7 BF3B A26F 54C8

And the new key is:

pub   4096R/3E338888 2009-05-11
      Key fingerprint = A8DF 1326 9E5D 9A38 E57C  FAC2 9D20 F650 3E33 8888

To fetch the full key (including a photo uid, which is commonly stripped by
public keyservers), you can get it with:

  wget -q -O- http://dottedmag.net/3e338888.pub | gpg --import -

Or, to fetch my new key from a public key server, you can simply do:

  gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 3E338888

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is signed by
the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 3E338888

If you don't already know my old key, or you just want to be double extra
paranoid, you can check the fingerprint against the one above:

  gpg --fingerprint 3E338888

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the UIDs match what you
expect, I'd appreciate it if you would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 3E338888

Lastly, if you could upload these signatures, i would appreciate it.  You can
either send me an e-mail with the new signatures:

  gpg --armor --export 3E338888 | mail -s 'OpenPGP Signatures' dottedmag@dottedmag.net

Or you can just upload the signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key 3E338888

Please let me know if there is any trouble, and sorry for the inconvenience.

Regards, Mikhail «dottedmag» Gusarov.
