# What do I bring to the table?

15 years of experience in varied projects.

Self-sufficiency and self-motivation.

Readiness to Get Things Done, as well as readiness to focus on long-
and short-term perspectives, and corresponding understanding that some things
should not need to be done at all.

Relentless striving
for [simplicity](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) and
strong belief that incidental complexity is the most frequent technical reason
of projects' demise.

Empirical approach to all tasks.

Readiness to work directly with customers, without shielding by the
intermediares.

Solid grasp of software engineering practices.

Experience of managing distributed teams.

Adherence (but not the blind kind) to Agile and Lean Startup ideas.

Appreciation of usability and UX in particular and aspiration to
improve in this field.

# Projects/Companies

## [Hola!](http://hola.org) (2013+)

Wearing my SRE hat, I have improved insight into performance of Hola services,
by adding
- centralised application-level logging, and
- application-level metrics,

which made it much easier to pinpoint and resolve performance problems and bugs.

I have created several internal-facing statistic dashboards for Hola VPN and
also user-facing statistics for Hola CDN,
[like this one](http://holacdn.com/cp/stats/dashboard?cust=portal_demo&embed=1).

Now I'm streamlining and simplifying onboarding for Hola CDN, making customers'
experience smoother, detecting and fixing website compatibility issues and
generally improving work efficiency of the onboarding team by providing better
tools and improving process.

## [Debian](https://debian.org/) (2006+)

I maintain several packages in Debian, mostly "scratching my own itch".

My Debian experience usually makes me a "resident Debian/Ubuntu expert" in all
companies I work for.

## [CFEngine](https://cfengine.com) (2011-2013)

I have thrust CFEngine from SunOS 4 times into 21 century (not single-handedly,
but pushing hard for the changes), converting it from R&D-ware to a reliable
software package along the way, adding unit and system testing, continuous
integration, discernible release management and other useful software
engineering practices.

## [OpenInkpot](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Openinkpot) (2007-2012)

A Linux distribution for eBook readers. It got eventually killed by Kindle, but
it was fun while it lasted.

I have started it, have built the infrastructure (from bugtracking to
cross-compiling Debian packages in CI environment to repository manager) and was
BDFLing it until it withered out.

Also I've got the experience managing distributed team in addition to previous
experince working in one.

## [Parallels](https://parallels.com) (2004-2007)

For Plesk for Unix I have created (in a team) a tool for transferring contents
of competing hosting panels to Plesk, which then was repurposed as a backup
system.

OpenFusion project was my first spell as a software architect. I have designed
SSO mechanism for Parallels apps, and also
a [Web applications packaging format](http://www.apsstandard.org/).

## [Open Source](/software)

I have contributed numberous patches to various open source projects, mostly
fixing problems I have encountered.

Are you running Ubuntu or Debian? Say `apt-cache show libssh2-1` and see the
Maintainer field.

Are you running Linux? Check out the `AUTHOR` stanza in `man 1 unshare`.
