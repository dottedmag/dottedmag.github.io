  title: Ghosts, crutches and code clarity.

<p>
  I have recently had to look at and interact with lots of pretty bad code in
  quite bad language, so I thought it might be a good idea to write about
  several concepts I picked up while studying computer science in university.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Code Ghost</b> is the set of assumptions which you can deduce
  (or <i>think</i> you can deduce) from the code itself. Loop invariants are
  Code Ghosts, pre- and post-conditions are Code Ghosts, entities' lifetime,
  interaction scenarios &mdash; there are lots of Code Ghosts you can think of
  in any piece of code you have written.
</p>
<p>
  What makes Code Ghosts important is the fact those are rarely materialized
  (like an ordinary ghosts), often kept in the head of the person who first
  thought about them (also like the ordinary ghosts) and knowledge about Code
  Ghosts is only distributed as legends (well, like actual ghosts): usually Code
  Ghosts aren't version-controlled, not managed in ticket systems and don't have
  documentation.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike regular Ghosts it is easy to spot Code Ghosts: give any brilliant
  programmer code he has never seen before and compare how long does it take to
  fix or add something, and how much she will break in the process. Then give
  the same task to the author of the code and see the sheer amount of implicit
  knowledge about the code hidden in her brain.
</p>
FIXME
<p>
  <b>Code Crutch</b> is the construction used only to overcome problems, bugs,
  inadequacies of language, library or environment.
